<p class="summary">Eamonn O'Brien-Strain is a senior technologist and
  technical leader with deep and broad experience as a system
  architect, project manager, agile coach, and computer science
  researcher.  He has worked in many application areas including
  embedded systems, hardware-software design automation, video
  authoring tools, print design tools, scalable web applications, and
  web page analysis.</p>

<p>At HP Labs, O'Brien-Strain is a principal engineer acting as the
software architect for <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2011/jan-mar/automated_publishing.html">Automated Publishing</a> where he lays
the foundation for integrating research technologies into scalable
  cloud services and
transferring them to the product divisions.  He has championed agile processes and engineering
practices on several projects and personally assembled and guided
agile teams to successful, high quality releases of Autophotobook SaaS
and <a href="http://www.tangible-web.com">Tangible Web</a>.  He has worked on pervasive computing,
synthesis of video from consumer media, designing platforms to advance
research in multimedia algorithms, and the use of on-line casual games
to help organize personal photo collections.</p>

<p>Before his current role as a researcher and system architect at HP Labs, he was an early part of the development team at two start-ups.  He also built chip and system design automation tools at various companies including GEC-Marconi Research in England, AT&amp;T Bell Labs in New Jersey, and Cadence Design Systems in California.</p>

<p>O'Brien-Strain chased the Silicon Valley dream in several start-ups, the latest of which was an Internet company providing a light-weight project management and collaboration platform for freelancers and small business, which HP acquired in 2001.</p>

<p>His open-source Web OS app, <a href="https://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=org.eamonn.nrby">Nrby Photos</a>, has had more than 10,000 downloads (despite still being in beta and not in the app store) and a four-star rating.</p>

<p>He has fourteen published patents (eight granted and six pending) with
more in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Employment History</h2>

  worked on an innovative consumer web service that combines gaming
  and photography.  Worked on custom television project that includes
  elements of DVRs, IPTV, podcasting, and collaborative filtering.
  Created a tool that used a movie-set metaphor and 3-D modeling to
  generate compelling video from users' photographs.  Previously
  worked on future mobile and ubiquitous Internet systems, including
  design tools and infrastructure for web service development,
  distributed data systems, and a global Internet naming system without a
  central authority.</dd>
  
<dd>Was main programmer for Sparta XML, an early open source Java package
  that includes lightweight XML parser, DOM, and XPath.</dd>
  
<dt>OneSpot, 2000 - 2001</dt>

<dd>Fourth person in start-up providing a collaboration Internet site
to small businesses.  Designed and implemented web multi-tier system
built on HTML templates, servlets, RMI APIs, and JMS messaging.
Worked as part of the team to shape the company's business
direction.</dd>


<dt>Various research labs, companies, and start-ups in electronic design automation</dt>

<dd>Before 2001 worked for GEC Hirst Research Centre (London),
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (New Jersey), Logic Modeling Systems (Bay
Area), and Cadence Design Systems (Bay Area). Built electronic design
automation (EDA) tools on Unix workstations used by hardware engineers
to design complex ASIC chips.  Advanced from a
research engineer to be a project manager leading a team of
developers.  Successfully guided several major software tools from
conception to revenue-generating products.  Designed and implemented
many advanced algorithms including a technique for propagating
simulated "unknown" values through a physical chip and synthesis
methodologies for automatically inserting built-in self-test circuitry
into chip designs. </dd>
