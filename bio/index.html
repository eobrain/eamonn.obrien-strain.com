<p class="summary">Eamonn O'Brien-Strain is a senior technologist and
  technical leader with deep and broad experience as a system
  architect, project manager, agile coach, and computer science
  researcher.  He has worked in many application areas including
  embedded systems, hardware-software design automation, video
  authoring tools, print design tools, scalable web applications, and
  web page analysis.</p>

<p>At HP Labs, O'Brien-Strain is a principal engineer acting as the
software architect for <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2011/jan-mar/automated_publishing.html">Automated Publishing</a> where he lays
the foundation for integrating research technologies into scalable
  cloud services and
transferring them to the product divisions.  He has championed agile processes and engineering
practices on several projects and personally assembled and guided
agile teams to successful, high quality releases of Autophotobook SaaS
and <a href="http://www.hpclipper.com">HP Clipper</a>.  He has worked on pervasive computing,
synthesis of video from consumer media, designing platforms to advance
research in multimedia algorithms, and the use of on-line casual games
to help organize personal photo collections.</p>

<p>Before his current role as a researcher and system architect at HP Labs, he was an early part of the development team at two start-ups.  He also built chip and system design automation tools at various companies including GEC-Marconi Research in England, AT&amp;T Bell Labs in New Jersey, and Cadence Design Systems in California.</p>

<p>O'Brien-Strain chased the Silicon Valley dream in several start-ups, the latest of which was an Internet company providing a light-weight project management and collaboration platform for freelancers and small business, which HP acquired in 2001.</p>

<p>His open-source projects
  include <a href="http://www.glawn.org/">Gla<sup>w</sup>n</a>, a very
  simple fully-static CMS and web-site builder
  and <a href="https://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=org.eamonn.nrby">Nrby
  Photos</a> a Web OS app has had more than 10,000 downloads (despite
  still being in beta and not in the app store) and a four-star rating.</p>

<p>He has twelve granted patents with
more in the pipeline.</p>

  generate compelling video from users' photographs.  Previously
  worked on future mobile and ubiquitous Internet systems, including
  design tools and infrastructure for web service development,
  distributed data systems, and a global Internet naming system without a
  central authority.</dd>
  
<dd>Was main programmer for Sparta XML, an early open source Java package
  that includes lightweight XML parser, DOM, and XPath.</dd>
  
<dt>OneSpot, 2000 - 2001</dt>

<dd>Fourth person in start-up providing a collaboration Internet site

direction.</dd>


<dt>Various research labs, companies, and start-ups in electronic design automation</dt>

<dd>Before 2001 worked for GEC Hirst Research Centre (London),
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (New Jersey), Logic Modeling Systems (Bay
Area), and Cadence Design Systems (Bay Area). Built electronic design
automation (EDA) tools on Unix workstations used by hardware engineers
to design complex ASIC chips.  Advanced from a
research engineer to be a project manager leading a team of
developers.  Successfully guided several major software tools from
conception to revenue-generating products.  Designed and implemented
many advanced algorithms including a technique for propagating
simulated "unknown" values through a physical chip and synthesis
methodologies for automatically inserting built-in self-test circuitry
into chip designs. </dd>

<h2>Granted U.S. Patents</h2>

<dl>

<dt>7,797,359 Recursive data naming</dt>
<dd>This patent addresses the problem of how to build a data-store overlay on a radically-distributed ensemble of devices. It combines aspects of DNS, distributed-file systems, REST, and key-value noSQL stores. It is designed to have no single points of failure, to be resilient to network partitions, and to have no central authority.</dd>

<dt>7,751,627 Image dominant line determination and use</dt>
<dd>Find the perceptually dominant line in the composition of a
  photograph.</dd>


<dt>7,721,085 Encryption of hierarchically structured information</dt>
<dd>How to encrypt an XML or JSON document, while preserving the
  hierarchical structure so that certain operations can still be
  performed without decryption.</dd>


<dt>7,668,400 Image layout constraint generation</dt>
<dd>How to select and layout photographs in a slideshow.</dd>

<dt>7,620,978 Securely propagating authentication in an ensemble of devices using single sign-on</dt>
<dd>Using cryptography to propagate mutual trust through a local
  network ensemble of personal devices.</dd>


<dt>7,596,751 Contact sheet based image management</dt>
<dd>Using a combination scanner/printer to organize a photo collection by printing out a thumbnails and scanning back the thumbnails with handwritten annotated instructions.</dd>


<dt>7,069,204 Method and system for performance level modeling and simulation of electronic systems having both hardware and software elements</dt>
<dd>A computer-aided-design tool that allowed the software and hardware of a complex embedded system to be designed and simulated together.</dd>


<dt>8,132,096 Image composition evaluation</dt>
<dd>Represent rules of photo composition (e.g. the rule of thirds) as a grayscale map. Represent how salient different parts of a photograph are by another grayscale map. Compare the two maps to find out how compositionally good the photo is, or shift the maps relative to each other so that the salient areas line up with the best areas compositionally, and thus get a nice cropping of a photograph.</dd>


<dt>8,301,669 Concurrent presentation of video segments enabling rapid
  video file comprehension</dt>
<dd>This is an array of short looping video thumbnails that move so that end of loop flows seamlessly into the beginning of the loop giving the illusion of continuously advancing snake of videos. You can
see overall structure of the video, concentrate on one point, or watch
  entire video by following one thumbnail.</dd>


<dt>8,275,733 Creating an album</dt>
<dd>Have people play games with their photos to gather metadata for
  creating photobooks.</dd>


<dt>8,275,745 Secure incremental updates to hierarchically structured information</dt>
<dd>In this scheme, a hierarchically structured file (e.g. XML or
  JSON) is represented as a flat set of triples of the form “elementId
  parentId elementValue”. Each triple is then encrypted into a pair
  like so “elementId encrypt(nonce, parentId,elementValue)”. The envisaged system is where an untrusted system is storing a large hierarchical tree, and a a trusted system wants to make incremental updates to it.</dd>

<dt>8,208,477 Data-dependent overlay network</dt>
<dd>This is an extension of standard peer-to-peer overlay P2P networks that can be more resilient to network partition. In a standard distributed hash table system, data objects are placed on different devices (“peers”) around the network without regard to how those data objects will be used.</dd>
