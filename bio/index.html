<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Eamonn O'Brien-Strain is a senior technologist with more than twenty
years experience as a system architect, agile project manager, and
computer science researcher.  He has worked in many application areas
including embedded systems, hardware-software design automation, video
authoring tools, print design tools, and scalable web applications.</p>

<p>At HP Labs, O'Brien-Strain has worked on pervasive computing,
synthesis of video from consumer media, designing platforms to advance
research in multimedia algorithms, and the use of online casual games
to help organize personal photo collections.  He is currently the
software architect for <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2011/jan-mar/automated_publishing.html">Automated Publishing</a> where he lays
the foundation for how the research technologies get integrated and
transferred.  He has championed agile processes and engineering
practices on several projects and personally assembled and guided
agile teams to successful, high quality releases of Autophotobook SaaS
and <a href="http://www.tangible-web.com">Tangible Web</a>.</p>

<p>Before his current role as a researcher and system architect at HP
Labs, he built chip and system design automation tools at various
companies including GEC-Marconi Research in England, AT&T Bell Labs in
New Jersey, and Cadence Design Systems in California.  He has also
chased the Silicon Valley dream in several start-ups, the latest of
which was an Internet company targeting small business, which HP
acquired in 2001.</p>

<p>His open-source WebOS app, <a href="https://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=org.eamonn.nrby">Nrby Photos</a>, has had more than 10,000 downloads (despite still being in beta and not in the app store) and a four-star rating.</p>

<p>He has thirteen published patents (seven granted and six pending) with
more in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Employment History</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 2001 - Present</dt>
<dd>Currently working on scalable architectures, services, and
  algorithms for intelligent web content transformation. Previously
  worked on an innovative consumer web service that combines gaming
  and photography.  Worked on custom television project that includes
  elements of DVRs, IPTV, podcasting, and collaborative filtering.
  Created a tool that used a movie-set metaphor and 3-D modeling to
  generate compelling video from users' photographs.  Previously
  worked on future mobile and ubiquitous Internet systems, including
  design tools and infrastructure for web service development,
  distributed data systems, global Internet naming systems without a
  central authority.</dd>
  
<dd>Was main programmer for Sparta XML, an open source Java package
  that includes lightweight XML parser, DOM, and XPath.</dd>
  
<dt>OneSpot, 2000 - 2001</dt>

<dd>Fourth person in startup providing a collaboration Internet site to small businesses.  Designed and implemented web n-tier system built on HTML templates, servlets, RMI APIs, and JMS messaging.  Worked as part of the team to shape the company's business direction.</dd>

<dt>Cadence Design Systems, 1993 - 2000</dt>
<dd>Senior software engineer and project manager, building design automation tools for simulation and synthesis of chips and embedded systems.  Worked with customers, system engineers, and systems programmers to identify needs and develop specifications. Served on standardization committee.  Pioneered use of Java and a UML-based object-oriented design methodology.</dd>
<dd>Successfully guided several major software tools from conception to revenue-generating products, including a tool that generated chip designs from DSP data-flow graphs and a system for generating hardware bus interfaces and software device drivers from a system specification.  Built and integrated many features including co-simulation at different levels of abstraction and sophisticated finite state machine editing.</dd>

<dt>Logic Modeling Systems, 1991 - 1993</dt>
<dd>For an embedded system that interfaced a physical chip with a simulated logic design, designed and implemented software running on UNIX workstations that links into digital logic simulators of all the major electronic design automation companies.  Also wrote software running under a real-time operating system on the embedded system.  Introduced formal object-oriented design techniques into the company.</dd>
<dd>Developed and implemented a technique for propagating simulated "unknown" values through a physical chip.  Designed the complex sub-system that controls the storing of the input stimuli, presenting them to the device being modeled, and sharing them between different users and simulator instances.  Introduced and organized formal code inspections.</dd>
<dd>Designed and implemented a C++ class library that provides to a simulator an object-oriented view of a hardware modeler.</dd>

<dt>AT&T Bell Laboratories, 1987 -1991</dt>
<dd>Requirements analysis, algorithm development, high-level design, coding, and testing of chip-design CAD tools using C++ on a Sun UNIX workstation.  Worked with chip designers and CAD tool developers throughout AT&T.</dd>
<dd>Developed and implemented hardware design-automation synthesis methodologies for automatically inserting built-in self-test circuitry into chip designs.  Introduced object-oriented design techniques and C++ into the group.  Developed coding standards as part of the task of improving the departmental software development process.</dd>

<dt>GEC Hirst Research Centre, 1984 - 1987</dt>
<dd>Worked on European Community research projects that studied the use of Petri nets for high-level specification and design of systems, and created an environment for high-level design-for-test.  Wrote CAD tools to route test vectors through a circuit to apply them to sub-circuits.  Designed and built a large general-purpose graphical net editor for manipulating, displaying, and simulating arbitrary hierarchically instantiated nets.</dd>
